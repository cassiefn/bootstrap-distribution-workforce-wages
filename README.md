# Bootstrap Distribution of Early Childhood Teacher Wages in Montana

This project attempts to answer the question of whether an early childhood teacher in Montana earns enough money to be considered above the national poverty line. A non-parametric bootstrap of both the mean and median hourly wage are performed.

The dataset for this project was collected through the Early Childhood Project Registry. This was part of a math stats group project for Montana State University in Spring 2018, and was used to help inform the Early Childhood Project about early childhood teacher wages in Montana.
